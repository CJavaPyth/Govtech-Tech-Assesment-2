# Govtech-Tech-Assesment-2

Codes are in 'Master' Branch

Backend Technical Assessment:
- Developed using Python Flask backend framework on VS Code IDE, and persistent SQL database SQLite3, as it is inbuilt into flask framework
- API endpoints were tested using Postman
- No scripts/migration codes should be needed to run the database. However, installation of "DB Browser for SQLite" may be needed for easy viewing of databse contents

1. run: "venv\Scripts\activate" on the terminal in VS Code for Windows OS to activate virtual environment
2. run "flask run" to launch flask server
